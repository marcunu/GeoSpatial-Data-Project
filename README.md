As a data engineer I have asked all the employees to show their preferences on where to place the new office. The goal is to place the new company offices in the best place for the company to grow. I have to find a place that more or less covers all the requirements.

* Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
* 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child.
* Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
* Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.
* Account managers need to travel a lot.
* Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, give them some place to go party.
* The CEO is vegan.
* If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.
* The office dogâ€”"Dobby" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.
